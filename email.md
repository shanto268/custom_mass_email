## actual email

Hi XXX,

I am a senior Applied Physics and Mathematics student at Texas Tech University, and I am considering applying to the XXX PhD program at XXX. I was wondering whether y'all are planning a virtual open house/info session/Q&A session with prospective grad students, and if so, how can I join in?

Also, if there is an email list that you guys have for grad student recruitment please feel free to add me there (just want to keep myself updated on any new information).

Hoping you are doing well and staying safe.
